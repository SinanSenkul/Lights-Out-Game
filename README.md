- An educational React app (one project from Colt Steele's React bootcamp), lights out game is one of the cult games of 80's.
- There's a 5 x 5 board component and cell components as child components.
- Each cell senses click events and toggles lights on/off of itself and it's neighbor cells.
- Game's objective is to light all the cells.
- I developed the code's 99% part myself. Only App.css and index.css is from the Colt's starter package. Logic is completely developed from scratch.
